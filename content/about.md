# Parea: A Definition
Parea translates from Greek to English as "company" but not in the way you think. Parea has many meanings. In Greek culture, a parea is a group of friends who regularly gather together to share their experiences about life, their philosophies, values, and ideas. In Spanish, parea means to pair up. Our Parea is a community of immense knowledge and expertise that partners with promising projects, teams, and individuals to build great products and make smart investments. 

# Parea: Who We Are
Parea is a collective of technologists, developers, inventors, and investors who write about the crypto market and build upon the blockchain technology. Blockchain is an exciting new space that is still in its infant stage. It is a technology that fundamentally alters our worldâ€™s delicate balance of power by changing our relationship with money, financial institutions, and governments. We seek to answer the questions this transformation raises. We help to build the new world that blockchain dares to create.

# Parea: What We Do
Our principal goal is to accelerate the pace at which this industry matures by working with the best teams and investors to weed out opportunists and focus energies and capital on truly innovative and transformative ideas. To that end, we primarily advise promising pre-ICO projects on fundamental business strategy, tokenomics, and technical viability.

### Parea: Who We Are
Parea is a Greek term for “a company of friends” - a collective that regularly gathers to share their experiences about life, their philosophies, values, and ideas. Our Parea is a community of technologists, developers, inventors, and investors that partners with promising projects, teams, and individuals to build great products and make smart investments.

### Parea: What We Do
Our principal goal is to accelerate the pace at which this industry matures by working with the best teams and investors to weed out opportunists and focus energies and capital on truly innovative and transformative ideas. To that end, we primarily advise promising pre-ICO projects on fundamental business strategy, token design, cryptoeconomics, and technical viability. We also work with VC's, hedge funds, and other investors to screen and evaluate blockchain investments.
